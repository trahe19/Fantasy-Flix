                It all started in a cramped apartment living room during Friday night movie marathons.
                Four roommates arguing over whether <em>"The Dark Knight Rises"</em> would beat <em>"The Avengers"</em>
                at the box office. What began as casual debate turned into heated competition.

                We'd write down our predictions for opening weekends, argue about production budgets we googled,
                and try to remember who said what about which movie.
